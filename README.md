# CONNECT Automate Faculty Entry

This [script](main.js) automates theory faculty entry in the CONNECT platform — the course offering and scheduling system developed and used by BRAC University. It reduces the manual burden of setting faculty name for each course section by automatically editing the already existing sections for a whole course.
